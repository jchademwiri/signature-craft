   - Build dedicated /export page with comprehensive installation guides
   - Implement .htm file download for Outlook desktop
   - Add PUT /api/signatures/:id endpoint for signature updates

2. **Enhanced Email Client Testing**
   - Test signature rendering across Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail
   - Validate mobile email client compatibility
   - Optimize HTML generation for maximum compatibility

3. **Performance & Accessibility**
   - Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Optimize loading times and user experience
   - Add comprehensive error handling and loading states

## Success Metrics (Current Status)

- **Technical Performance**: Page loads <3 seconds âœ…
