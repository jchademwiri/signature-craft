## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

- **Don't skip the Project Charter** - Even as a solo founder, you need clear scope
- **Don't over-document** - Focus on actionable documents that you'll actually use
- **Don't delay user stories** - These drive your entire development process
- **Don't forget compliance** - POPIA requirements are mandatory in South Africa

## üìû **Next Steps**

**Immediate actions (this week):**
1. Create Project Charter (defines official scope and success criteria)
