## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your-neon-db-url

# Authentication
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Development
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Next Steps (Phase 3 & Beyond)

1. **Complete Export System** - Build dedicated export page with comprehensive installation guides
2. **Email Client Testing** - Comprehensive testing across Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, and other clients
3. **API Completion** - Implement remaining endpoints for signature updates, deletion, and advanced export
4. **Performance Optimization** - Fine-tune loading times, image processing, and user experience
5. **Cross-Browser Testing** - Validate functionality across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
6. **Production Deployment** - Set up Vercel hosting with monitoring, analytics, and error tracking

## Success Metrics (MVP Goals)

- **User Acquisition**: 200+ registered users in 3 months
- **Activation Rate**: 70% create their first signature
- **Completion Rate**: 80% successfully export signature
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.0/5.0 average rating
- **Performance**: <3 second page load times
- **Retention**: 40% return within 7 days

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

- **Email Sending**: Currently logging password reset emails (implement actual email service in production)
- **Image Storage**: Using base64 in database (MVP approach - consider file storage service for scale)
- **Error Handling**: Good error handling implemented (enhance with comprehensive error tracking in production)
- **Testing**: No automated tests yet (add comprehensive test suite for production)
- **Analytics**: No usage tracking (implement user behavior analytics for production)
- **Export Enhancement**: Basic copy-paste implemented (add advanced export options and installation guides)
