## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your-neon-db-url

# Authentication
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Development
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Next Steps

1. **Implement User Dashboard** - Create the main user interface after login
2. **Build Signature Builder** - Core signature creation functionality
3. **Develop Template System** - Three signature template options
4. **Add Logo Upload** - Image processing and storage
5. **Create Real-time Preview** - Live signature preview as users type
6. **Build Export System** - HTML generation and copy-paste functionality

## Success Metrics (MVP Goals)

- **User Acquisition**: 200+ registered users in 3 months
- **Activation Rate**: 70% create their first signature
- **Completion Rate**: 80% successfully export signature
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.0/5.0 average rating
- **Performance**: <3 second page load times
- **Retention**: 40% return within 7 days

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

- **Email Sending**: Currently logging password reset emails (implement actual email service)
- **Image Storage**: Using base64 in database (consider file storage service for scale)
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling (implement comprehensive error tracking)
- **Testing**: No automated tests yet (add comprehensive test suite)
- **Analytics**: No usage tracking (implement user behavior analytics)
