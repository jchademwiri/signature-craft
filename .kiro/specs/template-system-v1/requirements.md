# Template System V1 Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the improvements needed for the SignatureCraft template system and the final preparations for v1 deployment. The focus is on creating a more maintainable template architecture, fixing email client compatibility issues, and ensuring the application is production-ready.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Self-Contained Template Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want templates to be self-contained with their own metadata, so that I can easily add, modify, and maintain signature templates without touching multiple files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new template is created THEN it SHALL include its own metadata (id, name, description)
2. WHEN templates are loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically register them using their metadata
3. WHEN template metadata is changed THEN it SHALL only require changes in the template file itself
4. WHEN a template is removed THEN it SHALL automatically be removed from all selectors and registries
5. IF a template is missing required metadata THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
6. WHEN templates are displayed in the UI THEN they SHALL use their own name and description from metadata

### Requirement 2: Email Client Export Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want to copy my signature and paste it directly into my email client with proper formatting, so that I don't see raw HTML code in my signature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Copy for Gmail" THEN the system SHALL copy HTML that renders properly when pasted into Gmail's signature editor
2. WHEN a user clicks "Copy for Outlook" THEN the system SHALL copy content that renders properly when pasted into Outlook's signature editor
3. WHEN a user clicks "Copy for Apple Mail" THEN the system SHALL copy content that renders properly when pasted into Apple Mail's signature editor
4. WHEN a user pastes the copied signature THEN they SHALL see the formatted signature, not raw HTML code
5. WHEN images are included in signatures THEN they SHALL display correctly in all supported email clients
6. IF an email client doesn't support the format THEN the system SHALL provide alternative instructions
7. WHEN signatures are pasted THEN all styling (colors, fonts, spacing) SHALL be preserved
8. WHEN signatures are sent in emails THEN they SHALL display correctly to recipients

### Requirement 3: Template Component Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the template selector to show accurate previews and descriptions, so that I can choose the right template for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the template selector loads THEN it SHALL display all available templates with their names and descriptions
2. WHEN a template preview is shown THEN it SHALL use the actual template component for rendering
3. WHEN a user switches templates THEN all their entered data SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN a template is selected THEN the preview SHALL immediately update with the new layout
5. WHEN templates are rendered THEN they SHALL use consistent styling and props
6. IF a template fails to load THEN the system SHALL show a fallback and error message

### Requirement 4: Production Deployment Readiness

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the application to be stable and performant in production, so that users have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL load within 3 seconds on average
2. WHEN users interact with the signature builder THEN responses SHALL be under 500ms
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly logged and handled gracefully
4. WHEN the database is under load THEN queries SHALL complete within 100ms average
5. WHEN images are processed THEN they SHALL be optimized for web delivery
6. IF the application encounters errors THEN users SHALL see helpful error messages
7. WHEN the application is monitored THEN key metrics SHALL be tracked and alerted on
8. WHEN users access the application THEN it SHALL work across all supported browsers

### Requirement 5: Template Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a dedicated preview page with sidebar navigation, so that I can easily test and develop email signature templates in a controlled environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the `/preview` page THEN it SHALL display a sidebar with all available signature templates
2. WHEN I click on a template in the sidebar THEN it SHALL show a preview of that template design
3. WHEN I select a template THEN the preview SHALL use sample data to demonstrate the template layout
4. WHEN I view template previews THEN I SHALL see how they render with different data combinations
5. WHEN I test templates THEN I SHALL be able to see desktop and mobile views
6. WHEN I navigate between templates THEN the transitions SHALL be smooth and responsive
7. WHEN I use the preview environment THEN it SHALL help me test email signature compatibility
8. IF a template has rendering issues THEN they SHALL be clearly visible in the preview environment

### Requirement 6: Form Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want my form to be prefilled with existing data when editing a signature, so that I don't lose information and can make incremental changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects "Edit" for an existing signature THEN the form SHALL be prefilled with all data from the database
2. WHEN loading signature data THEN the system SHALL preserve all fields including colors and logo
3. WHEN a user makes changes to a prefilled form THEN only the modified fields SHALL be updated
4. WHEN a form is prefilled THEN the template selection SHALL match the signature's original template
5. WHEN editing a signature THEN the preview SHALL immediately show the existing signature
6. IF signature data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message and fallback to defaults
7. WHEN a user cancels editing THEN the system SHALL discard changes without affecting the stored signature
8. WHEN a user saves an edited signature THEN the system SHALL update the database with all form fields

### Requirement 7: Code Quality and Maintainability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be well-organized and documented, so that future development and maintenance is efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow TypeScript strict mode requirements
2. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL have proper type definitions
3. WHEN functions are implemented THEN they SHALL have clear interfaces and error handling
4. WHEN imports are used THEN they SHALL use consistent path aliases
5. IF code quality issues exist THEN they SHALL be identified and resolved before deployment
6. WHEN documentation is needed THEN it SHALL be clear and up-to-date
