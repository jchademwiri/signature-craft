```markdown
- [x] 1. Completed task description
  - Implementation details
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3_

- [-] 2. Not started task description  
  - Implementation details
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 4.2_
```

### Requirements Format Standards
```markdown
### Requirement 1: Feature Name

**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
2. IF [condition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
```
